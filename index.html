            <h1>Ficus</h1>
            <p>
                Ficus is a genus of around 850 species of trees, shrubs, and vines found in tropical and subtropical
                regions worldwide. It is a popular choice for indoor plants due to their attractive foliage and ease of
                care.

                It is important to keep it in a bright, indirect light and water it regularly, allowing the soil to dry
                out slightly between waterings. Ficus plants also benefit from occasional fertilization and pruning to
                promote healthy growth and prevent overgrowth. Additionally, it is important to keep the plant away from
                cold drafts and to monitor for pests such as spider mites or mealybugs. With proper care, a ficus plant
                can provide years of beautiful foliage and be a great addition to any indoor space.
